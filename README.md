🎭 FaceSmasher

Because sometimes, you just need to see faces... smashed.

FaceSmasher is a project born out of a fascination with facial recognition and data processing. It’s designed to [insert one sentence: e.g., "detect and analyze facial features" or "reconstruct facial data"] using a mix of Python and some clever logic.

Whether you're here to explore the code or just curious about how it works, welcome!


🚀 The Vision
The goal of FaceSmasher isn't just to process images—it's to do it efficiently and accurately. As a graduating student deep-diving into Java, Python, and Machine Learning, I built this to bridge the gap between "cool theory" and "working code."

✨ Key Features
Smart Detection: Leveraging Python-based libraries to identify facial landmarks.

Fast Processing: Optimized to handle image data without making your CPU cry.

Clean Architecture: Built with a focus on modularity (so it’s actually readable).

🛠️ Built With
Python: The powerhouse behind the logic.

[OpenCV/TensorFlow/Mediapipe?]: The "eyes" of the project.
