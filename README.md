# Facesmasher
DAY1 of FACESAMSHER : (17K site traffic)

 I launched a "mini-viral" project last night, and the serverless backend didn't sweat once.

I decided to build a simple social experiment called Facemash-Engine a game of "Who has the best profile pic?" where users choose between two players in a continuous loop.🎀🌚
I was just hoping for a few clicks to test things out, but the site ended up getting hit over 17,000 times as people cycled through and voted on new images. 🤯

A few quick notes on the build:

The Frontend: I prioritized building a high-performance, interactive UI. The goal was to make the image-cycling loop feel addictive and seamless for the user, ensuring zero friction during the voting process.

It's 100% Serverless : Architected a robust, event-driven backend using AWS Lambda. By decoupling the logic from the infrastructure, I achieved a stable, "zero-maintenance" system that scales elastically based on demand.

Architectural Flow: The most rewarding part was seeing the observability metrics. Even with a constant stream of requests, the latency remained rock-solid.

It’s one thing to run code on your local machine; it’s another to see a serverless build handle 17k interactions on its first night out.
